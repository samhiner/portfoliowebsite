	<h2 style='text-align: center;'>What is a Trading Floor?</h2>
	<p style='text-align: center;'>
		This video shows what trading floors in real life are like. <br><br>
		<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLySXTIBS3c?start=10" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br><br>
		Essentially, each individual wants to trade a stock, and they are looking for someone to make a deal with.<br>
		There are a lot of people looking to make deals, so it is a bit chaotic, but that is part of the fun!<br><br>
	</p>

	<h2 style='text-align: center;'>What is a Happening Next Tuesday?</h2>
	<p style='text-align: center;'>
		We are going to be simulating a trading floor in <strong>Ms. Long's room (G216) for all of SMART lunch</strong>. Everyone<br>
		will get an order on their MacBook, and then will have to find someone else in the room to make a deal with<br><br>
	</p>

	<h2 style='text-align: center;'>Why Participate?</h2>
	<p style='text-align: center;'>
		Even if you are not sure whether you will enjoy the trading floor, <strong>you can just come for a few minutes to try it out</strong><br>
		After all, the great thing about high school is that you can try new things that you didn't think you would like.
	</p>

	<h2 style='text-align: center;'>Info to Remember</h2>
	<p style='text-align: center;'>
		Don't forget that the meeting is next Tuesday in G216. <strong>Invite your friends!</strong> The more people we have, the more fun it will be<br>
		You do not need to be in the club to participate.
