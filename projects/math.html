	<h1>Attempt at a Complete Axiomatisation of Mathematics</h1>

	<h2>Preface</h2>
	<p>I recently began reading Gowers' <i>Mathematics: A Very Short Introduction</i>, I was<br>
	instantly enchanted by the idea of deriving all of mathematics from a series of axioms,<br>
	almost like mathematics was a language, and other languages would consist of different<br>
	axioms. However, I am barely a quarter of the way into the book, and have very little<br>
	idea of what I am trying to do. From Google, it seems like using axioms to describe<br>
	things is common, but I could not find anything about a full body of axioms that could<br>
	be used to describe all of math. This may be because what I am saying has no meaning (how<br>
	do you define all of mathematics?) or because it is an extremely complicated undertaking<br>
	(like modeling the roll of a die with physics). As I learn more, I may give this up, but<br>
	I find the idea extremely interesting, so I wanted to create a new page to cement the<br>
	idea in my head and so I can list my progress if it does turn out to be possible for me<br>
	to do. I hope to write here again soon with positive news.</p>

	<h2>Notes</h2>
	<p>Could start with defining operations with the Peano axioms and show how they can be<br>
	manipulated using the axioms in Gowers' book.</p>
