	<h1>Purpose</h1>
	<p>I was reading Gowers' <i>Mathematics: A Very Short Introduction</i>, and read a section<br>
	where he suggested that math not only is not only based on the common rules that I referenced<br>
	in the archived preface at the bottom of this (like the distributive property), but even the<br>
	logic that we use to hop from premise to conclusion can be boiled down to something resembling<br>
	a deductive argument (All x's are y's; y's are yellow; Therefore, all x's are yellow) and<br>
	some key assumptions, such as the idea that if something works for n, and n + 1 then it will<br>
	work for all numbers up to infinity.</p>

	<p>With that in mind, I want to create a set of rules that define all of algebra as it is<br>
	commonly used. I want to systematically isolate all of these assumptions that we make and<br>
	define them. I think that such a system would be helpful in understanding how experiences<br>
	can affect what we percieve to be fully logical. Put more conctretely, I would imagine that<br>
	there is an unquestioned assumption that is made in mathematics that, if altered, would not<br>
	create an inconsistent system. I do not know for sure that such a thing exists, but I would<br>
	not be suprised, as everyone to do mathematics has been human, and has been subject to some<br>
	of the same prejudices due to the simple fact of being human. <br>

	<p>Of course, saying that I will discover something like that is very ambitious and would be<br>
	an overestimation of my ability. However, I will still attempt to create this body of rules,<br>
	as it will at least be helpful for myself in gaining a deeper understanding of what exactly<br>
	mathematics is.</p>

	<h1>Preface</h1>
	<p>This model accepts that there is no *thing* that is a number. It is useful to define a number<br>
	as something when you are using the algebra model, like 3 sheep, but you can also use the model<br>
	to define things that are not discrete objects, like length. Even further, numbers can be used<br>
	only to define equations to model things like parabolas. How a number is used varies in each of<br>
	these models, so all that matters is that we create a consistent system in which all of these<br>
	things can be modeled.</p>

	<p>Because there is no deep, inherent concept of a number, as described in the last paragraph,<br>
	we can define it as anything that gets the job done, as I will do below.</p>

	<h2>Preface (12/02/18)</h2>
	<p>I recently began reading Gowers' <i>Mathematics: A Very Short Introduction</i>, I was<br>
	instantly enchanted by the idea of deriving all of mathematics from a series of axioms,<br>
	almost like mathematics was a language, and other languages would consist of different<br>
	axioms. However, I am barely a quarter of the way into the book, and have very little<br>
	idea of what I am trying to do. From Google, it seems like using axioms to describe<br>
	things is common, but I could not find anything about a full body of axioms that could<br>
	be used to describe all of math. This may be because what I am saying has no meaning (how<br>
	do you define all of mathematics?) or because it is an extremely complicated undertaking<br>
	(like modeling the roll of a die with physics). As I learn more, I may give this up, but<br>
	I find the idea extremely interesting, so I wanted to create a new page to cement the<br>
	idea in my head and so I can list my progress if it does turn out to be possible for me<br>
	to do. I hope to write here again soon with positive news.</p>

	<h2>Notes (12/02/18)</h2>
	<p>Could start with defining operations with the Peano axioms and show how they can be<br>
	manipulated using the axioms in Gowers' book.</p>
