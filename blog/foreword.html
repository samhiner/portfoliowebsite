	I have decided to create a repository for things I learn/experiments I conduct
	in the form of a blog. This is because I feel like I learn many very interesting
	things and have interesting experiences, but, as a human, I easily forget them
	This way, my experiences are forever stored on the internet, and I can look back
	on them when I would have otherwise forgotten them.

	If I am able to stick with this, I might format it and make it something that is
	more accessible to others. However, I am not going to try to target it to an
	audience, so I don't think it would be something that would gain a consistent
	following (after all, you would have to have an interest most of the same
	fields as me and be on a similar technical level in those fields (whether that
	be knowledgeable or novice)). Nevertheless, individual articles may be useful to
	others, so there is a reason to format it later on.
